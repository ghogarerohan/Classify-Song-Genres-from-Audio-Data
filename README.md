## Project Description

Using a dataset comprised of songs of different genres, trained a classifier to distinguish between the two genres based only on track information. Initially, made use of pandas and seaborn packages in Python for sub setting the data, aggregating information, and creating plots when exploring the data for obvious trends or factors. Thereafter, used the scikit-learn package to predict whether it is possible to correctly classify a song's genre based on features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, etc
